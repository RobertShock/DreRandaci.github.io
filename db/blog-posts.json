CSS is definitely something I want to be good at because it will most likely frustrate me more than the other languages (look out, JS). I&#39;ve been getting better at understanding the Chrome dev tools, and that is SUPER helpful, especially for layout and just seeing where tf everything is. We had our first JS lesson last night and I&#39;m pumped to see how I digust actually making programs. Stoked!",

      "content": "Javascript is intimidating and mind bending; so much power with such little code! The possibilites are endless with how you use it. I'm not going to pretend like I fully understand it yet, as I struggled with the YDKJS: Tax Rate challenge but nearly came close to getting it correct. Starting to see some progress and less blank staring at my laptop screen (although, this is likely to come back around as class gets denser!).",

      "content": "So, we had the 'Coin Counter' exercise this week, which basically helped to kick my arse into high gear for what's to come. As frustrating as JS can be, there is an immense satisfaction in finding solutions. Things I learned during this exercise: 1) If in doubt, start wherever you know. Try things. Try a lot of things. Especially in codewars (holy shit, hard af right now but super helpful and fun). 2) When working with others or in groups, make sure to try and tackle one problem at a time. Things can branch off quickly and get murky. Otherwise, I just need to keep practicing and working on as many different problems as possible.",

This may seem harsh, but there are positive qualities to this analogy I'd like to promulgate â€“ but before I do that, I will say JS is awesomely challenging. Very algebraic and openly solvent, it has inspred me to relearn some mathematical concepts that have been dead to me for years. As far as being fresh and salty, it is just that; accepting of multitudes of solutions, yet ready to kick you to the curb when you forget to text it a winky face before bed. So far I feel great about it. I just need to work on economizing my actual computations.",
