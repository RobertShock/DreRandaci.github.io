CSS is definitely something I want to be good at because it will most likely frustrate me more than the other languages (look out, JS). I&#39;ve been getting better at understanding the Chrome dev tools, and that is SUPER helpful, especially for layout and just seeing where tf everything is. We had our first JS lesson last night and I&#39;m pumped to see how I digust actually making programs. Stoked!",

As frustrating as JS can be, there is an immense satisfaction in finding solutions. Things I learned during this exercise: 1) If in doubt, start wherever you know. Try things. Try a lot of things. Especially in codewars (holy cow, very challenging, but super helpful). 2) When working with others or in groups, make sure to try and tackle one problem at a time. Things can branch off quickly and get murky. Otherwise, I just need to keep practicing and working on as many different problems as possible.",
