- [x] Create 2 new HTML pages: Projects and About Me
- [x] Add links to these 2 new pages to your existing navigation bar.
- [x] Update your navigation bar with the following interactivity.

- [x] When the user hovers over one of the links, the color of the text should change.
- [x] When the user hovers over one of the links, the background color of the element that contains the link should change.
- [x] When the user clicks on one of the links, the element that contains the link should grow in size by 5px on the left and right.

(start thinking about fonts and what will be in a flexbox)
	font-family: 'Gruppo', cursive;
	font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
	font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;

- [x] Create 1 new HTML page: Blog
- [x] Add a link to this blog page in your existing navigation.
- [x] Create at least 5 blog entry "cards" for now. Each card should have:
	- [x] A header section containing an H4 title and the date the blog was written.
    - [x] A content section containing your body of text. These entries should be themed around your journey into development. As you discover new tricks, tips and tools, write about your discovery. Write about what you have tried and why it did or did not work. These entries will be helpful for you as you speak with other members of the development community (and will be helpful when you are frustrated - look how far you've come). For now, you can use placeholder text, but this should be your place to continue writing throughout this course.
- [x] Your page should follow this mockup. Use Flexbox to achieve this: 

- [x] Open your main.js file and blog.html.
- [x] Create a JSON file that contains all the information for your blog posts ("blog-posts.json") - hopefully you've been keeping up with it ðŸ˜‰. 
- [x] Validate your JSON file.
- [x] Create an XHR to load the data from your local json file.
- [x] Loop over the blogs array returned from your XHR and build up the HTML card elements using the values from your blog objects.
- [x] Add the HTML you created in the last step to the blog-holder element.
